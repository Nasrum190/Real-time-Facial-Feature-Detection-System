# Real-time-Facial-Feature-Detection-System
This project utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection along with detection of facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. It provides a simple and efficient way to identify and highlight these features in live video streams.

Features:
1. Detects faces in real-time video streams using Haarcascades.
2. Identifies and highlights facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth.
3. Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image processing.
